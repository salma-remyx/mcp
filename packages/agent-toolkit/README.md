# @mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit

A powerful toolkit for building AI agents that interact with the monday.com API. This package provides a set of tools and utilities to help you create AI-powered integrations with monday.com through Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit
```

## Subpath Exports

The package provides several modular components that can be imported separately:

- `@mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit/mcp` - MCP server implementation
- `@mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit/core` - Core utilities and base classes
- `@mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit/openai` - OpenAI integration

## Available Tools

The toolkit includes several pre-built tools for common monday.com operations, organized by functionality:

### Item Operations

- `CreateItemTool` - Create a new item in a monday.com board
- `DeleteItemTool` - Delete an item from a board
- `GetBoardItemsPageTool` - Get items by board id and apply filters
- `CreateUpdateTool` - Create a new update on a specific item
- `ChangeItemColumnValuesTool` - Change the column values of an item in a monday.com board
- `MoveItemToGroupTool` - Move an item to a group in a monday.com board

### Board Operations

- `CreateBoardTool` - Create a monday.com board
- `GetBoardSchemaTool` - Get board schema (columns and groups) by board id
- `CreateGroupTool` - Create a new group in a monday.com board
- `CreateColumnTool` - Create a new column in a monday.com board
- `DeleteColumnTool` - Delete a column from a monday.com board

### WorkForms Operations

- `CreateFormTool` - Create a monday.com form
- `GetFormTool` - Get a form by its token, found in the form's URL
- `UpdateFormTool` - Update a monday.com form, including updating the form's feature settings, appearance settings, accessibility settings, title, description, question order, form tags, and form password
- `FormQuestionsEditorTool` - Create, update, or delete a question in a monday.com form

### Account Operations

- `ListUsersAndTeams` - Get users or teams, either by ids, names or by searching the account

### Workspace Operations

- `ListWorkspaceTool` - List workspaces available to the user, prioritizing workspaces where the user is a member

### Dynamic API Tools

- `AllMondayApiTool` - Execute any monday.com API operation by generating GraphQL queries and mutations dynamically
- `GetGraphQLSchemaTool` - Fetch the monday.com GraphQL schema structure including query and mutation definitions
- `GetTypeDetailsTool` - Get detailed information about a specific GraphQL type from the monday.com API schema

### Dynamic Tool Gating (Lazy Schema Loading)

- `gateByIntent(intent, options?)` on `DynamicToolManager` enables only the registered tools whose schema vocabulary overlaps the current turn intent (plus any `alwaysOn` tools) and disables the rest, so full schemas for off-topic tools are not injected every turn. The companion `gate()` helper in `tool-gating` exposes the two-phase split: a cheap summary entry for every tool and an on-demand detail pool of full schemas for the gated subset, with an estimated per-turn token-tax reduction. (Capability adapted from _Tool Attention Is All You Need_.)

## Development

A Cursor skill is available at `.cursor/skills/agent-toolkit-api-tools/SKILL.md` with detailed guidance on creating and modifying platform API tools, including the GraphQL codegen pipeline, tool registration, and version bumping.
